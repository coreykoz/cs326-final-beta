Innovative Idea: 

We want to create a personal finance application that is catered to students in college. We want to create an application that is able to keep track of expenses as well as factor in unique features that are specific to students, like not having a steady income or “normal” monthly expenses as a normal working adult would. 

There are a few existing applications that perform similar functions to what we want to do, but they tend to be restrictive in nature. For example, Mint allows you to create a budget based on category, visualize spending over the month, track bills you have coming up, and reassess your financial portfolio. With our app, we would like to implement similar features but allow for more customization on visualizations while also catering to college lifestyles by asking questions on living styles and spending styles upon set-up so that each user can have a better budget according to their needs. For example, a student living off-campus with no meal plan will probably have more things to spend on versus a student living on-campus with a meal plan. We would want to ask a series of questions in regards to these living styles and then suggest budgets based on that.

Important Components:

One component we would have for our app is to have an initial survey when the user signs up to use the app. In the initial survey, we would have a series of questions asking about the user’s normal expenses. Some examples of questions would be:
    Do you live on or off campus?
    Do you have a meal plan?
    Do you get groceries?
    Do you have a car?
    Do you have loan payments?
    Do you have monthly subscription payments?
Based on the answers to the initial set of questions, we would further ask about the amounts the user pays for each of the categories. For example, a follow-up to someone who answered “yes” to question 4 would be, “How much do you spend on gas per month?”. Using these questions will enable us to create a fully customized budget plan for the user. This way, the user has control in terms of what categories they are seeing their spending for. 

Our web application will contain a section regarding transaction history that will primarily rely on user inputs for its data. There will be an additional section portraying the user’s spending habits using different visualizations such as bar graphs, scatterplots, pie charts, etc. To contrast, Mint only presents spending habits as pie charts which aren’t very user friendly and can be misleading at times too. These visualizations will also show trends of how long a user’s current spending habits can be sustainable using predictive analytics.

Another feature we are interested in implementing is a receipt logger that could scan and read in receipts, extract the amounts and categorize them as a type of transaction. This would allow the user to much more easily input their transaction data into our system, similar to how Mobile Check deposits work.

All of these features would be tied to a user account as each aspect is unique to each user.
