## Wireframes and HTML/CSS

Here’s a list of our web application’s wireframes and screenshots of pages:

 Log In page: this is the first page that a user will see when they navigate to our website. They will be asked to enter a username and password or create a new account.

Create Account page: If this is a new user, they will be redirected to the Create Account page from the login page and asked to enter their name, email address, age, and a new password. 


Survey: Once the user has created an account, they will be directed to fill out a survey that asks them about their living situation, meal plan, transportation costs, and any other monthly expenses they may have. 

Home page: Once a user is logged in, they see the home page which shows them the bigger picture of their finances for the last few months, including a pie chart, bar plot, a scatter plot. On this page, they will also be able to view their entire transaction history and input a transaction be it an expense or an income.



Add Expense pop-up: When users click on the Add Expense button on the home screen, a window pops up with input fields asking for a name for the expense, for example,  “Winter boots”. The other fields ask for the amount of the expense and the date that the purchase occurred. The last field is a drop down menu that categorizes the transaction into one of 7 categories. 


Add Income pop-up: When users click on the Add Income button, a window will pop up prompting users to enter details such as the income amount, a name for the income, for example, “Paycheck from xyz job”. The users will also be asked to select how the income was received: cash, check, gift, direct deposit.




## Division of Labor
Each group member worked on one of the HTML files independently (index.html, survey.html, create-acc.html) and all three of us collaborated in creating the (main.html) file, any additional CSS required, and the javascript required in creating the charts.
